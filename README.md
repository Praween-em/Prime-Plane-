# PrimePlanee

This is a simple python program that plots the mersenne prime equation 
y +1 = (2^x), particuloarly on the prime plane 
the x coordinates and y coordinates of the system are all prime numbers, making it a prime plane

The repository also contains a java file writer program that creates a text file of prime numbers upto a certain number and writes it to the file named PrimeNumbers.txt, this file can be furtur used in python and other languages as an input for [x,y] coordinates, to generate a cartesian plane of prime numbers.
